why feature scaling

features { magnitudes , units }
height  { 160 ,124} 
weights {45,  56}

for example if we have 124450 values in one feature if we r using K means cluster in that we are creating some points in data set 124450 is so big we cant map in plot so we need to scale that value


scaling should happen respective feature


which algorithm requied for scaling

* Linear Regression
* K means (unsupervised )
* KNN 

  linear regression is bascially found out with the help of gradient descent 
  in linear regression the coefficient should be converge at global minima
  
doesnot required feature scaling technique

* Decision Tree (if u do scaling or not doing that tree branch will be same)
* RF
* XG boost
